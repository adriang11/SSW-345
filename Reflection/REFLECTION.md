### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

    Using agile methods as well as kanban and related methods was the most helpful. It also helped to have an open look at what can be done in the project and being able to change things as you go along, genereally "project reflexivity".

### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

    The most helpful factor in implementating integration tests and mocking for this project was the deployment of the bot on Heroku, a cloud application platform. Paired with this, our team created a channel on Discord specifically for testing, that way all of our team members could test the bot at any time of the day in an organized manner.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

    The most difficult aspect of testing was understanding the root cause of certain errors and bugs as well as reproducing errors for other team members. Towards the end of the project we introduced more logging strategies that really streamlined the process of bugfixing. In the future, I would implement this step earlier on to save time in testing.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

    Some testing methods I would try again on a future project include using a supplementary logging service such as JSNLog to help with debugging.

### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

    The most helpful part about using a kanban board in our project was that it was easy to visualize what tasks and features needed to be completed as well as who was working what and what has already been completed. The feature of assigning tasks was also useful as it tracked which team members were working on a given part, avoiding conflicts. Doing code reviews also forced us understand what new features were being introduced at each merge. Physically reading through someone's code helps to understand the project better than say a verbal explanation.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

    The most difficult aspect of the development process was the lack of regular meetings. While we did have lengthy conversations over chat, it would have been much better for the team for everyone to join a call at the same team and discuss updates and their vision for the project.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

    This project helped to highlight the importance of code reviews in a team setting, making pull requests easier to manage. As a result, regular code reviewing is something I definitely see myself implementing in a future project.
