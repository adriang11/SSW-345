# Reflection

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

    The most helpful aspect in thinking about our design was the agile methodology. This allowed our team to react to new information and adjust the scope of our project as we went along with development.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

    The most difficult aspect of the project was accounting for the many integrations and libraries needed to get the bot fully functional such as Node, Discord Js, Heroku, etc. In the future, I would have the documentation for each integration handy to better understand how the technology is intended to be used.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

    Although we never got the chance to implement a concrete design pattern into our project, there were a few considerations made to increase the longevity of our project if we were to continue this in the future. For example, we did extensive research on decorator and strategy patterns which, while not immediately applicable to our project, would have simplified the process of adding new functionality while protecting existing code.

### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

    The most helpful factor in implementating integration tests and mocking for this project was the deployment of the bot on Heroku, a cloud application platform. Paired with this, our team created a channel on Discord specifically for testing, that way all of our team members could test the bot at any time of the day in an organized manner.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

    The most difficult aspect of testing was understanding the root cause of certain errors and bugs as well as reproducing errors for other team members. Towards the end of the project we introduced more logging strategies that really streamlined the process of bugfixing. In the future, I would implement this step earlier on to save time in testing.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

    Some testing methods I would try again on a future project include using a supplementary logging service such as JSNLog to help with debugging.

### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

    The most helpful part about using a kanban board in our project was that it was easy to visualize what tasks and features needed to be completed as well as who was working what and what has already been completed. The feature of assigning tasks was also useful as it tracked which team members were working on a given part, avoiding conflicts. Doing code reviews also forced us understand what new features were being introduced at each merge. Physically reading through someone's code helps to understand the project better than say a verbal explanation.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

    The most difficult aspect of the development process was the lack of regular meetings. While we did have lengthy conversations over chat, it would have been much better for the team for everyone to join a call at the same team and discuss updates and their vision for the project.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

    This project helped to highlight the importance of code reviews in a team setting, making pull requests easier to manage. As a result, regular code reviewing is something I definitely see myself implementing in a future project.

### Overall
Throughout this project we were able to encapsulate design considerations, implementation techniques and agile software development processes which allowed us to deliver a functional and presentable product. Design pattern considerations allowed us to keep our code consice and uncoupled. Testing the product regularly rather than solely at the end saved us time in the long run by minimizing bugs and thus increasing valuable development time. Using kanban as an agile technique was undoubtedly a huge factor in our success in this project as well as it allowed for greater visibility in task assignment and burndown. Combining all of these practices allowed our team to become more effective developers and has enabled us to be more efficient when starting new software projects.
